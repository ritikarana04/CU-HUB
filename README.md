# CU-HUB
Covid-19 has disrupted our normal lifestyle and everything has shifted to virtual platform. Now we are not getting the same experience which we were getting in  physical classes where interaction with teacher’s and classmates was so easy ,where clearing doubts was so easy. So we are introducing ‘CU HUB’ the android application which would be a miniature of our college website.
 Earlier it was difficult to get college notification and information by logging into website everytime and also it was difficult to connect with teachers but CU HUB will be a one stop solution of above mentioned problems .this application will facilitate communication between students and faculties via database.

One of the best thing about CU HUB is that only authorized students and faculties will be able to join this platform as, admin will have all the rights to add and remove students and faculties so no outsiders can join this platform this feature will improve the security which is a need of every organization. 

This app will have a separate login page for faculties, students and admin. Students will have the facility to talk with any teacher separately and they will also have the contact details of all the teachers of the college. Earlier if we had any problrm related to assignments, homework or any important notification we want to connect to the teachers but sometimes we could not get the contact information of teachers at the right time so, to solve this problem we will attach each and every teachers details to this app which will be visible to all the students.


Teachers will have the facility to upload circulars which will be made visible to every students and through this teacher can easily convey their message to a large number of students this will reduce the work load of teachers as earlier if teachers had to convey any message to whole department they use to message in groups separately or convey to every class representative which was a hectic task to do
